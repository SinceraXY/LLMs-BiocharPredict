In this research, thresholds were proposed for the feedstock's moisture content (max. 30 wt% dm) [22] and ash content (max. 15 wt% dm). Feedstock streams with desirable ash and moisture content were investigated in the presence of PTEs (Pb, Cd, Cu, Ni, Hg, Zn, Cr, As) because these can cause primary and secondary pollution. Thresholds were placed according to the European biochar certificate standard (EBC-AGRO) [48]. Furthermore, the feedstock's fixed carbon content (min. 15 wt% on a dry-ash free basis (daf)) was evaluated. Non-selected feedstocks may be suitable for slow pyrolysis after proper pre-treatment steps (dewatering, de-ashing, blending with other feedstocks,.) that may result in a higher biochar production cost [49], [50], [51].","The feedstocks selected were shredded in an SM100 Retch over a 1 cm × 1 cm sieve.

Bamboo chips,"Bamboo chips purchased from local farms in Huzhou (Zhejiang, China) were used as raw materials. Before preparation, the bamboo chips were washed with deionized water to remove impurities.","Before preparation, the bamboo chips were washed with deionized water to remove impurities. After drying in the oven, the chips were crushed and sieved to 0.425–2.00 mm. Potassium oxalate monohydrate (K2C2O4·H2O) and potassium bicarbonate (KHCO3) were used as activation reagents. In a typical process, about 10 g of bamboo chips was mixed with the activation reagent with a mass ratio of 1:2. After mechanical stirring, it was fed into the OTF-1200X-5 L tube furnace (Kejing, China). The pyrolysis process was first carried out under N2 atmosphere, with a flow rate of 400 mL/min. The carrier gas was converted into ammonia (NH3) when the temperature reached 500 °C, 600 °C, and 700 °C, respectively. The residence time was kept for 2 h to ensure complete reaction. The tube furnace was then cooled to room temperature, and the solid residue was collected. The solid residue was washed with 1 M hydrochloric acid and deionized water until the filtrate was neutral, and dried overnight for later use. The preparation process is shown in Fig. S1. Solid residue of biochar was recorded as TKCBC-N or TKHBC-N.

Willow catkin,"However, even the most economically and facilely prepared graphene materials are nowhere near cost and facility competitive with direct pyrolysis carbon precursors, such as biowaste [20], [21], [22] or biomass [23], [24], [25], [26], [27] with containing cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin biopolymer, into PCNs with graphene-like morphology. Willow catkin, as a kind of common biomass, is inedible to human and has no economic value. The worse is that willow catkin breathed into the nasal cavity may cause intense stimulation, cough and asthma. Especially in spring, the willow catkin can easily cause skin allergic reactions, such as itching, eye conjunctival inflammation. But we are surprised to find that it is an ideal carbon precursor for synthesis of value-added PCNs by one-step pyrolysis and activation method.","Briefly, the willow catkin was washed with acetone and deionized water, and then was treated with ultrasound for removing seeds. Subsequently, the willow catkin along with a certain amount of potassium hydroxide was poured into 100 ml deionized water and heated until all of the DI water was evaporated.

Finally, the obtained carbon materials were washed by 3 M HCl solution and DI water several times and collected after vacuum dry. The actual final yield of carbon is about 5.5 wt% (e.g. ~0.55 g carbon can be collected from per 10 g willow catkin each time). The collected samples were named as PCNsX-Y, where X is the weight of willow catkin that was kept constant at 1 g and Y indicates the weight of KOH (PCNs1-Y).

grape marcs,"Yantai, Shandong Province is the largest wine-producing area in China, and there are a large number of grape marcs (GMs) in need of treatment every year. According to statistics, GMs produced by 100 kg of grapes are about 25 kg, which are mainly consisting of grape skins, stalks and seeds, accounting for 70%, 12% and 18% [34,35], respectively. Consequently, it’s urgent to develop comprehensive utilization technology which could transform them into high value-added products. Herein, we reported the preparation of N-doped porous biocarbon from GMs with urea as the N-doping agent and KOH as an activator. The obtained material has an SSA of 2221.4 m2 g−1 and N-content of 2.04 atm.%, which significantly boost its electrochemical activity. In three-electrode test systems, the material displayed high specific capacitances of 446.0, 345.5 and 310.0 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 in 1 M H2SO4, 6 M KOH and 1 M Na2SO4, respectively.

The carbonized carbon,"Herein, we have chosen the dragon fruit (Hylocereus undatus) peel for the first time as a different biowaste material to synthesize the N-doped mesopore-dominated AC (N-dfAC) for realizing the high performance supercapacitor. After carbonizing the raw material and the subsequent activation with KOH, the authors performed a simultaneous N-doping using melamine as an external nitrogen source. The authors found that moderate N-doping content of 3.4 at. % resulted in the highest specific surface area of 2667 m2/g and appropriate pore size distribution with a high pore volume and pore diameter. In order to find the effect of the N-doping level on the electrochemical performance of AC supercapacitor, we first performed a three-electrode testing experiment in an aqueous electrolyte. Then, we designed the symmetric coin cell supercapacitor using the electrodes with an optimized N-doping level and pore structure, demonstrating a reliable cyclic stability and excellent specific energy at a high working voltage (≥3.5 V) in organic electrolytes.","The carbonized carbon was mixed simultaneously with KOH for activation and melamine for doping and then heated at 800 °C for 2 h. The doping process finally yields N-dfAC, in which some of the carbon atoms are replaced by the various types of N atoms. The anticipated molecular configuration of N includes pyridinic N, pyrrolic N, graphitic or quaternary N, and oxidized N (Figure 1). The dfAC electrodes’ morphology was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) before and after N-doping with the melamine. Without melamine, the carbonized dragon fruit peel using KOH can produce only bulk carbon particulates of several microns (Figure 2a). However, melamine addition during the KOH activation process results in a drastic change in the morphology (Figure 2b–d). At a lower amount of melamine (i.e., 0.5 wt %), the bulk carbon framework is converted to spherically aggregated porous nanoparticles. Upon increasing the amount of melamine to 1 wt %, the spherical aggregates formed an interconnected structure. The dragon fruit peel mainly consists of linoleic acid, oleic acid, and palmitic acid, which have high stability under the activation process. Therefore, KOH’s sole contribution leads to an inefficient etching of the stable portion, resulting in a bulk morphology. The energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis confirms the homogeneous distribution of C (83.4 at. %), N (3.6 at. %), and O (13 at. %) elements in N-dfAC-0.5 (Figure 2e–g).

Subsequently, 1 g of RSM powder and 1 g of KOH were added to 10 mL deionized water with continuous stirring for 4 h, and then dried at 80 °C for 12 h. The mixture was transferred in a porcelain boat and put in a tubular furnace for further activation. The activator KOH can react with the carbon precursor at the elevated temperature to form a porous structure. The generated CO, CO2, and K could further etch the carbon network to form the micro- and meso-porous structures. The activation operation was conducted at 550 °C for 2 h, with a temperature rising rate of 5 °C min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere. After cooling down to room temperature, the mixture was collected and cleaned with 1 M hydrochloric acid and washed with distilled water several times to remove impurities including K2CO3, KHCO3, and KOH.

Corn straws,"Corn straws are gathered from farmland of north China and thoroughly washed to remove impurities. All the chemical reagent, including KOH, Na2SO4, H2SO4 and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) emulsion etc. are analytical pure and are purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. The pyrolysis reactor was a home-made fluidized bed, which can heat corn straw in an inert atmosphere. The biochar were obtained as a solid residue in a yield about 40% via a flash pyrolysis of corn straws on a home-made fluidized bed at a temperature of 450 °C. Biodiesel was collected in a beaker and the separated biochar was the raw material in this study [47].","The biochar-based carbons were prepared from corn straw biochar via a KOH activation method. The typical procedure of biochar-based carbons is that: 100–200 mesh of biochar powder are firstly mixed with different proportion of KOH and small amount of H2O.

Sunflower,"Sunflower stalk is one sustainable biomass source containing substantial cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, three of which are the promising precursor for producing carbonaceous materials. In this work, sunflower stalk was selected as the starting material to prepare hydrochar (HC), pyrolytic carbon (PC), and activated carbon (AC) through a simple, environment-friendly and low-temperature hydrothermal carbonization (HTC), and an effective activation method, as illustrated in Figure 1. The ready-prepared AC was successfully applied as the electrode material in high-performance SCs. A very high specific capacitance value up to 365 F g–1 was measured through a three-electrode SC system at 1 A g–1. Importantly, SCs with AC as the electrode material maintained a high capacitance capability of 81% at 20 A g–1 and an outstanding cycling retention rate as high as 95% following 15 000 cycles. What’s more, the symmetrical SCs delivered a large energy density with about 35.7 Wh kg–1 at the power density of 989 W kg–1. To further understand the superior performance of AC in SCs, the synergistic effects of HTC and high-temperature activation methods were elucidated. This research may present a pathway for effectively utilizing biomass resources to prepare highly active carbon materials for energy storage in SCs.","As illustrated in Figure 1, sunflower stalk was splitted into small pieces, washed with tap water, and dried at 105 °C in a lab stove. The processed sunflower stalk was crushed into powders, as shown in Figure S1 (Supporting Information), and then grinded and screened by the sieve of 8000 meshes to make an average particle size of smaller than 2 μm.

Wood residues ,"Wood residues from white birch (WB) sampled from sawmills in Québec, Canada, were first converted into biochars. In summary, the biochar (BWB) was produced through a CarbonFX fast pyrolysis plant (developed by Airex Energy Inc., Bécancour, QC, Canada) at 455 °C in an oxygen-free environment. Chemical and physical activation of the BWB were then achieved using KOH and CO2 gas, respectively, through an in-house pilot-scale furnace. The furnace is composed of three parts: (1) a feed hopper, (2) a screw conveyor tube placed in a muffle furnace, and (3) a recovery hopper. The details of the furnaces and materials preparation have been described elsewhere [13]. For chemical activation, biochar impregnation was achieved by mixing biochar, KOH (in pellets) and water in proportions of 1:1:2 based on mass. The mixture was kept at room temperature for 2 h and then dried overnight at 120 °C in an oven. KOH-impregnated biochar was placed in the feed hopper and the screw conveyor was switched on to activate and transport the material (for approximately 1 h) to the recovery hopper under a nitrogen atmosphere once the furnace temperature reached 900 °C. The material was then washed with distilled water until a pH ~ 7 was reached and dried overnight at 105 °C. An almost identical procedure was performed for the physical activation. BWB was placed in the same furnace under nitrogen atmosphere and CO2 at 3 L min−1 injected for approximately 1 h once the temperature reached 900 °C.
